## Overview

Self-driving cars have come a long way from basic lane keeping assist to full autonomous capability, due to the success of Tesla and Waymo. They are pretty good at driving in urban settings, but fail miserably in offroad conditions. This is due to the absence of a structured environment, which self-driving cars take advantage of in cities.

My work as an intern at [Moon Lab](https://moonlab.iiserb.ac.in/index.html) during the Summer of 2025, focuses on improving the offroad navigation capabilities. I implemented a visuo-motor policy inspired from the [Learning by Cheating](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12294) paper, and deployed it in an ATV. The project is discussed in detail in the following sections.
