HeyðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m an undergraduate at IISER Thiruvananthapuram, studying **Mathematics, Physics, and Data Science**. I created this website to share my knowledge and experiences, hoping it will serve as a platform to showcase my academic projects, coding endeavours, and insights gained during my studies.

How did it all start? My school introduced me to programming at the age of 13. I started coding in Java, and wrote several programs as part of my assignments. One of my early projects was a program that translated Morse code into English, which impressed my teacher. My friends and I then collaborated on another program that translated our secret code language.

When the pandemic hit, I was locked down at home and took the opportunity to expand my skills further. I learned how to create websites, explored Python, and discovered Manim, a library for animating mathematical concepts.

Over the years, I have explored various fields, but my primary interest lies in,
{{< typeit breakLines=false loop=true lifeLike=true >}}
mathematics.
computer science.
robotics.
economics. {{< /typeit >}}

Currently, I am delving into **artificial intelligence**, working on small projects to apply and expand my knowledge in this exciting area.

Aside from my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing badminton. I love listening to Shreya Ghoshal's songs (also Cherry's songs). I'm passionate about cooking, and I enjoy travelling and going out on adventures.

I have also taken interest in *cars*, *bikes* and *rockets* !!!
