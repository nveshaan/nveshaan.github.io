I’m an undergraduate at [IISER Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/), studying Mathematics, Physics, and Data Science. I created this website to share my knowledge and experiences, hoping it will serve as a platform to showcase my academic projects, coding endeavours, and insights gained during my studies.

My school exposed me to programming at the age of 13. I started coding in Java and wrote several programs as part of my assignments. One of my early projects was a program that translated Morse code into English, which impressed my teacher. My friends and I then collaborated on another program that translated our secret code language.\
When the pandemic hit, I was locked down at home and took the opportunity to expand my skills further. I learned how to create websites, explored Python, and discovered [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), a library for animating mathematical concepts.

Over the years, I have explored various fields, but my primary interests lie in mathematics, computer science, robotics, and economics. Currently, I am delving into artificial intelligence, working on small [projects](/projects) to apply and expand my knowledge in this exciting area.

Aside from my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing tennis and badminton. I love listening to Shreya Ghoshal's songs (also Cherry's songs). I'm passionate about cooking and eating, and I enjoy travelling and doing adventure activities.
