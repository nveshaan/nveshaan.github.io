Hey👋, I’m an undergraduate at **IISER Thiruvananthapuram**, majoring in *Data-Science*. I created this website to share my thoughts and experiences, hoping it will serve as a platform to showcase my academic projects, coding endeavours, and insights gained during my studies.

I started out with a simple "Hello World" code, but after seeing a computer beat the top Go player, I was amazed to see how far artificial intelligence has come, from doing exactly what it has been told to, to surpassing humans. Since then, I noticed the impact of AI on more interesting problems, from protein folding to self-driving cars.

Over time, I have studied and built many projects around AI, but my primary interest lies in,

neural networks.
deep reinforcement learning.
robotics.
diffusion.
ml engineering.
{{< /typeit >}}

Until now, I have worked on improving human-computer interfaces, autonomous navigation systems and financial series forecasting. I am learning more about reinforcement learning and diffusion, and I plan to apply these concepts in algorithmic trading, control problems, and multi-agent settings.
