## Overview

Welcome back folks! So far, we have implemented a neural network using nothing but NumPy. It gave us a better understanding of the underlying back-propagation algorithm. In this post, we will dive deep into the network and visualize what each layer and each neuron is doing. On a side note, we will be switching to PyTorch to make our lives a little easier :)
