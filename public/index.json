I will use Python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib to create a model that classifies hand-written digits.\nWhy implement a Neural Net from scratch? #\rThere are plenty of ML frameworks that offer out-of-the-box functionality for building neural networks. However, implementing one from scratch is a valuable exercise. It helps you understand how neural networks work under the hood, which is essential for designing effective models.\nFor a deep dive into neural networks, check out 3Blue1Brown\u0026rsquo;s series. Here, I\u0026rsquo;ll focus on the practical implementation.\rArchitecture #\rThe model will consist of an input layer of 784 neurons, two hidden layers with 16 neurons each and an output layer with 10 neurons. This is a very simple configuration relative to modern standards.\nImplementation #\rSetup #\rAs mentioned above, I will import the required Python libraries.\nimport numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib as plt ","date":"21 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/digit-classifier/","section":"Blog","summary":"Overview #\rIn this post, I will implement a neural network without using popular ML frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras.","title":"Coding a Neural Network from scratch","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"21 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/machine-learning/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Machine Learning","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"21 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"nveshaan","summary":"","title":"nveshaan","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"21 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"HeyðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m an undergraduate at IISER Thiruvananthapuram, studying Mathematics, Physics, and Data Science. I created this website to share my knowledge and experiences, hoping it will serve as a platform to showcase my academic projects, coding endeavours, and insights gained during my studies.\nOverview My school exposed me to programming at the age of 13. I started coding in Java and wrote several programs as part of my assignments. One of my early projects was a program that translated Morse code into English, which impressed my teacher. My friends and I then collaborated on another program that translated our secret code language.\nWhen the pandemic hit, I was locked down at home and took the opportunity to expand my skills further. I learned how to create websites (React), explored Python, and discovered Manim, a library for animating mathematical concepts.\nOver the years, I have explored various fields, but my primary interest lies in, Currently, I am delving into artificial intelligence, working on small projects to apply and expand my knowledge in this exciting area.\nHobbies Aside from my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing tennis and badminton. I love listening to Shreya Ghoshal\u0026rsquo;s songs (also Cherry\u0026rsquo;s songs). I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about cooking and eating, and I enjoy travelling and doing adventure activities.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"nveshaan","summary":"HeyðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m an undergraduate at IISER Thiruvananthapuram, studying Mathematics, Physics, and Data Science.","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"Feel free to connect with me:\nGitHub LinkedIn Email (nveshaan23@iisertvm.ac.in) CV (PDF) ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/contact/","section":"nveshaan","summary":"Feel free to connect with me:","title":"Contact","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
